Suggestions to do next:

- Filtering using probabilistic neural networks + RNNs
- Kalman filter + SVM
- Time series stuff like autocorrelation
- Decide the time scale of the forecast
- Adding some other weather information in that area for additional features
- Plot wind speed vs power for any one turbine atleast (power curve)
